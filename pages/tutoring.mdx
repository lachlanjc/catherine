# Mathematics Tutoring

I am available to tutor <mark>middle and high school students in math courses</mark>, on any time basis, from a single session to a yearlong commitment. My experience ranges from short-term help with homework, to working with students between levels over the summer, to serving as a primary instructor for a homeschooling student.

Most of my experience has been between pre-algebra and geometry (typically 7th–10th grade, depending on placement), but if you are interested in working with me for a level higher or lower than these subjects, please [reach out](mailto:catherine.campbell617@gmail.com). I am also happy to work on SAT math preparation, including the level I and II mathematics subject exams. See my [CV](/cv) for details on my educational background.

I’m available <mark>in-person or via Zoom video chat</mark>, and I charge on a sliding scale, depending on subject level, length of commitment, and family situation. Fees begin at $25/hr, generally billed biweekly. I value opportunities to teach all kinds of students, and will work with you to make it possible, so don’t hesitate to be in touch if you are concerned about financial arrangements.
