# Catherine Campbell

I am an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, studying the history of medicine. After finishing my B.A., I hope to pursue seminary studies, and eventually work as a health care chaplain.

On campus, I strive to build nurturing communities, both as an RA to first-year students, and as a leader in the interfaith community. I am a member of the Monthly Meeting of Friends of Philadelphia (the actual Quakers, and yes, I love oatmeal!), which meets in a beautiful 215-year-old meetinghouse in the Old City neighborhood. The rest of the week, I can generally be found either in a library or a ballet studioâ€”I love practicing, watching, and choreographing ballet; reading and writing; and studying religion and spirituality.
