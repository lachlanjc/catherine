# Catherine Campbell

I am an M.A. student, studying in the Peace and Social Transformation program at the [Earlham School of Religion](https://esr.earlham.edu). Before coming to ESR, I studied the history of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Beginning in the fall of 2021, I will be studying in the M.Div. program at the Yale Divinity School.

I am a member of the [Monthly Meeting of Friends of Philadelphia](https://www.fgcquaker.org/cloud/monthly-meeting-friends-philadelphia-arch-street-quakers), which meets in a beautiful 215-year-old meetinghouse in the Old City neighborhood, and these days on Zoom. Among Philadelphia Yearly Meeting [Young Adult Friends](https://www.pym.org/young-adult-friends/), I serve as co-clerk and as a member of the pastoral care committee for our community. I also sing with the [Yale Camerata at the Institute of Sacred Music](https://www.youtube.com/user/yaleismtv), and work as a volunteer intern with the [Centre LGBTQA Support Network](http://centrelgbtqa.org). I am the proud big sister of [@lachlanjc](https://lachlanjc.com); an enthusiastic student of ballet, sacred music, and spirituality; and an aspiring future health care chaplain.
