# Catherine Campbell

I am an M.A. student in Peace and Social Transformation at the [Earlham School of Religion](https://esr.earlham.edu), the Quaker seminary in Richmond, IN. Before coming to ESR, I studied the history of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Beginning in the fall of 2021, I will be studying in the M.Div. program at the Yale Divinity School.

I am a member of the [Monthly Meeting of Friends of Philadelphia](https://www.fgcquaker.org/cloud/monthly-meeting-friends-philadelphia-arch-street-quakers), which meets in a beautiful 215-year-old meetinghouse in the Old City neighborhood, and these days on Zoom. I also serve as a co-clerk for the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting [Young Adult Friends](https://www.pym.org/young-adult-friends/), and on the pastoral care committee for our community. I am the proud big sister of [@lachlanjc](https://lachlanjc.com); an enthusiastic student of ballet, choral music, plainchant, and theology; and an aspiring future health care chaplain.
