# Catherine Campbell

I am a current M.Div. student at the Yale Divinity School in New Haven, CT, affiliated with the Berkeley Divinity School program. Before coming to Yale, I was a member of the first cohort of M.A. students in Peace and Social Transformation at the [Earlham School of Religion](https://esr.earlham.edu). My undergraduate study was in the history of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. 
  
I am a member of the [Monthly Meeting of Friends of Philadelphia](https://www.fgcquaker.org/cloud/monthly-meeting-friends-philadelphia-arch-street-quakers), which worships in a quiet 215-year-old meetinghouse in the Old City neighborhood, as well as a clerk and leader in the [Young Adult Friends community](https://www.pym.org/young-adult-friends/). I also sing in the chapel choirs of the Berkeley Divinity School and at Yaleâ€™s beautiful [Marquand Chapel](https://www.youtube.com/user/yaleismtv), and constantly find myself the proud big sister of [@lachlanjc](https:/lachlanjc.com).
