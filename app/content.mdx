# Catherine Campbell

I am a current Chaplain Resident at the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, NJ. I recently graduated from the M.Div. program at the Yale Divinity School in New Haven, CT, where I also pursued the Diploma in Anglican Studies at the [Berkeley Divinity School at Yale](http://berkeleydivinity.yale.edu/). Before coming to Yale, I was a member of the first cohort of M.A. students in Peace and Social Transformation at the [Earlham School of Religion](https://esr.earlham.edu), and completed my undergraduate study in the history of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

My current worshipping community is [Christ Church, New Brunswick](https://www.christchurchnewbrunswick.org/), where I serve in the parish choir. During my time at Yale, I was in student liturgical and musical leadership in our seminary chapel, St. Luke’s; at [Christ Church, New Haven](https://christchurchnh.org/); and at Yale’s beautiful [Marquand Chapel](https://www.youtube.com/user/yaleismtv).

Though I now inhabit a range of Episcopal Church and Roman Catholic spaces, I have come by way of the Religious Society of Friends. During college, I was received into membership at the [Monthly Meeting of Friends of Philadelphia](https://www.fgcquaker.org/cloud/monthly-meeting-friends-philadelphia-arch-street-quakers), which worships in silence in a beautiful 215-year-old meetinghouse in the Old City neighborhood. I constantly find myself the proud big sister of [@lachlanjc](https://lachlanjc.com).
