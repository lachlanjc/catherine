# Catherine Campbell

I am a current student at Yale Divinity School and the [Institute of Sacred Music](https://ism.yale.edu) in New Haven, CT, pursuing an S.T.M. in Liturgical Studies. My current area of academic focus is the development and revision of materials for the Daily Office among Anglican religious sisters.

I return to Yale from a year as a chaplain resident at the [Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital](https://www.rwjbh.org/rwj-university-hospital-new-brunswick/patients-visitors/spiritual-care/) in New Brunswick, NJ, where I completed the Clinical Pastoral Education sequence and worked especially with trauma, cardiovascular intensive care and transplant, and oncology patients. I am a 2024 graduate from the Yale Divinity School M.Div. program, alongside which I received the Diploma in Anglican Studies at the [Berkeley Divinity School at Yale](http://berkeleydivinity.yale.edu/). Prior to my M.Div., I was a member of the first cohort of M.A. students in Peace and Social Transformation at the [Earlham School of Religion](https://esr.earlham.edu), and completed my undergraduate study in the history of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

My theological, liturgical, and musical commitments currently bring me into fellowship with Episcopal Church, Roman Catholic, and ecumenical communities at Yale, and I belong to the parish choir at [Christ Church, New Haven](https://www.christchurchnh.org/#home). I have previously been in service and leadership in St. Luke’s Chapel at Berkeley Divinity School; at Yale’s [Marquand Chapel](https://www.youtube.com/user/yaleismtv); and during my chaplain residency, at [Christ Church, New Brunswick](https://www.christchurchnewbrunswick.org). However, I have come to these various communities by way of the formation I received first among the Religious Society of Friends. During college, I was received into membership at the [Monthly Meeting of Friends of Philadelphia](https://www.archstreetfriends.org), which worships in silence in a beautiful 215-year-old meetinghouse in the Old City neighborhood. 

When I’m not at school or at church, I might be found rejoicing in any number of choir rehearsals or gatherings of English or Scottish country dancers, or chipping determinedly away at both ancient and contemporary Anglican and Catholic hymn and chant repertoire as an enthusiastic beginner organist. I constantly find myself the proud big sister of [@lachlanjc](https://lachlanjc.com).
